Those unfamiliar with fishing think of it as a patience game involving
sitting by a pond or lake with a hook in the water. While this is one version of the truth,
and while this may be enjoyable (especially in combination with good friends, alcohol, or both)
-- this hardly represents all that fishing has to offer. Fishing doesn't always
involve patience: in many styles of fishing are it's an active sport where participants
chase wild creatures to experience a sacred tug of war.

Before 2016, I had only gone fishing a couple of times. Once was when I was very
young -- it was with my dad and family friends on an east coast party boat.
We didn't catch much of anything, except one very persistent bait-stealing ray.
Another time I went to the local pond with a high school classmate, and we caught
some stocked catfish. My mom refused to cook the catfish and made me release them
in a stream near our home. The very next day a red-tailed hawk devoured the poor fish
on our back lawn.

These being my experiences, I told my partner "I would like to eat a fish that I've
caught," and she surprised me in May of 2016, booking a chartered trip onto San
Francisco bay. It wasn't a particularly good fishing day, but I caught an 8lbs
Halibut, the biggest fish of the trip. The powerful fish bent my rod, pulled the line,
and just like that _I_ was hooked.

I'm an engineer, so it did occur to me that fishing with hook and line is not an
efficient way to procure fish for food. There's also a luck component, which people
overrate the same way they overrate the role of luck in poker. If I can go to any old
grocery store and buy fish, why should I care to learn to fish? And if nets are more
efficient than hook-and-line, why bother with this outmoded technique?

To understand this, it's important to let go of the "fish as food" aspect of
fishing. Certainly, if you want to eat fish, supermarkets are the lowest effort
method of scoring something yummy. Instead, the factors that made catching an
8lbs Halibut so enthralling included:

* __The surprise of encounter__: before we hooked up, I didn't know what kind of
  fish would be at the end of the line, I didn't know how big it would be, and I
  didn't know when it would bite. There is an enormous amount of excitement when
  you see line beginning to peel off the reel, and when you hear the drag of the
  reel screeching.
* __The intensity of the fight__: fishing with hook and line really boils down to a
  tug-of-war between person and fish. The fish is trying hard to get away -- the
  rod and reel are applying an amount of pressure in the opposite direction, and
  as the fish tires, the human is cranking the fish closer and closer so that it
  can be netted and brought aboard / ashore. You can feel the vibrations as the
  fish swims and shakes its head. When you get it close to the boat, the fish
  often gets a burst of adrenaline and shoots off on another big run. The
  experience is bananas.
* __The beauty of nature__: it felt magical to find a big powerful creature in
  its natural habitat and to then feel it in my hands. It was correspondingly
  sad when the deckhands bonked it with a bat and bled the creature to make it
  good for consumption. What's very cool about fishing, unlike hunting, is that
  you do have the option to let the fish go at the end, and if you handle them
  correctly, they return to nature unharmed. What you win in this exchange is an
  intimate moment with mother nature the same way you might enjoy experiencing the
  scale of an elephant, or the ferocity of a feasting lion, or the beauty of a
  colorful butterfly.

One joyful aspect that I felt missing on this particular trip was:

* __The satisfaction of skill__: on a party boat, gear is provided to you and
  deckhands help you tie knots, rigs, and untangle when you mess up. The captain
  decides where to drive the boat to give clients the best chance at hooking up
  with a fish. Beyond dropping a line and reeling at the most exciting moment,
  there is not much you need to do.

Having finally caught a good-eating fish, I became very excited about learning
to recreate this experience from scratch. Instead of relying on someone else to
know where the fish are, what they're eating, and setting things up, I wanted to
be able to do this independently.

However I would soon discover that the world of fishing is vast. I wished there
was a curriculum for learning the sport of fishing end to end, and there is not
really such a thing. All-encompassing books like Ken Shultz's Fishing
Encyclopedia only really make sense once you've gotten into the sport.

So that is what this is. The plan is to provide a general curriculum for folks
who want to learn about fishing.

I grew up on the east coast near Raritan Bay, and currently live on the west
coast near San Francisco Bay, and I've fished all around the country. I've
surf fished for striped bass in Rhode Island, fly fished for trout in Montana,
caught largemouth bass in Texas, smallmouth bass in Michigan, spotted bay bass
in San Diego, and reef fish in Hawaii. The one kind of fishing I will not be
including information on is ice fishing, which I haven't had the opportunity to
do, but you can be sure it's on my bucket list!

Did that last paragraph sound like a bunch of jibberish? That's okay! The point
is, this guide will be relevant no matter where you are fishing. And it's just a
starting point: once you know the terminology, you will be able to make use of
all the resources on the internet (especially YouTube) to continue learning more.
