If you just want to catch a fish, this is the article for you. You want to know where to fish,
and what to target, what equipment to buy, and where to get it. Let's go over these items.

## Where to Fish

I'm based in the USA, so my recommendations will only be specific to this country. However, you can
use my recommendations to fish in your country -- just compare the climate of different US zones to the
climate in your home country. In warmer countries, you can basically throw a hook and line 

## What to target

### Trout

### Catfish

### Bluefish & Striper

### Surfperch

### Tropical / Warmwater


## Equipment to buy

The equipment you need will depend a bit on what you're targeting, but generally for beginners I would advise the following items:

* A fishing license. In the United States, each state you visit requires a different license, and they usually run for a calendar year.
  If you're fishing outside of your state of residence, they usually charge you more. Annual fishing licenses can be as cheap as $20 for
  the year in smaller states to $200 in states with larger fisheries. Your license purchase helps to fund wildlife enforcement, stocking
  programs, etc. I always view my purchases as donations to the public!
* A "spinning" reel size 2500 if freshwater fishing, 4000 if saltwater fishing. Saltwater is more expensive because you need the reel to
  resist saltwater intrusion and corrosion.
  * Freshwater: [Shimano Sienna FG 2500](https://fish.shimano.com/content/fish/northamerica/us/en/homepage/Shimano_Product_Page.P-SIENNA_FG.html) ~$35
  * Saltwater: [Daiwa BG](https://daiwa.us/products/bg-sw-spinning) size 4000. Smaller is okay too! ~$110. You can get cheaper, but this is the
    best bang for the buck. The [Penn Battle III](https://www.pennfishing.com/products/battle-iii-spinning-1523128) is also good.
* Line to put on the reel.
  * [300yd P-Line Fluoroclear](http://p-line.com/line/fluorocarbon-coated/floroclear): for total versatility, I like 6lbs for freshwater and 20lbs for saltwater. ~$11
  * [300yd Power Pro Super8Slick V2](https://www.powerpro.com/content/powerpro/northamerica/us/en/homepage/SSV2.html):
    If you want to try braided line and have the money, you can get something like this (~$40) but be prepared to spend more time tying knots.
    Not recommended if you're just starting out. I like 30lbs for saltwater fishing, and 10lbs for freshwater fishing.
* A fishing pole.
  * Freshwater: [7' Ugly Stik GX2 Medium 2PC (Model USSP702M)](https://www.purefishing.com/products/gx2-spinning-rod-1264735?variant=34572601884805)
  * Saltwater: [9'6" Okuma Celilo Medium-Light 2PC CE-S-962MLa](https://okumafishingusa.com/products/celilo)
* Egg sinkers
  * Lead (cheap, effective, wash your hands after handling): [Bullet Weights Egg Sinkers]()
  * Tungsten (premium, eco-friendly, expensive): 
* Some swivels

Again this is assuming total beginner. As you become more experienced you can pick equivalent items or better ones
or cheaper ones that still fit the bill.
